# Week 7 Lesson 2 #
## Python: Plotting ##

In this lesson, you will learn to work with Matplotlib, which is the
standard plotting library for Python programs.  You will use an iPython
notebook to explore the basic Matplotlib Python statements to make and
annotate a simple plot. You also will be introduced to the Seaborn
plotting library, which enhances the power of MatPlotlib by simplifying
the creation of aesthetically attractive visualizations and introducing
new plot types.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand how to use Matplotlib within an iPython notebook to make a simple, inline plot.
- Understand how to use Matplotlib to label the plot axes and to apply a title to a plot
- Understand how to use Matplotlib to change the plot limits to increase the impact of a plot.
- Understand how to use Seaborn within an IPython Notebook.
