# Week 1 Lesson 2 #
## Machine Learning: Pre-processing ##

In this lesson you will learn about the importance of understanding your
data, and how to perform necessary pre-processing. This is an important
step to ensure later analyses are actually correct and reliable.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic components of data for machine learning
- Understand the concept of a model and how it is relevant for machine learning
- Understand different issues that might be present in a data set. 

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.
