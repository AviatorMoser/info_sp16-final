# Welcome to INFO 490: Foundations of Data Science #

***Professor:*** Dr. Robert Brunner

***Teaching Assistants:*** 

1. Avinash Balakrishnan

This class is an asynchronous, online course. This course will build a practical foundation for data science
by teaching students basic tools and techniques that can scale to large computational systems and massive data sets.

Students will first learn how to work at a Unix command prompt before learning about source code control software 
like git and the github site. Next, the Python programming language will be covered, with a focus on specific aspects
of the language and associated Python modules that are relevant for Data Science. Python will be introduced and used
primarily via the IPython (or Jupyter) Notebooks, and will cover the Numpy, Scipy, MatPlotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, and
scikit_learn Python modules. These capabilities will be demonstrated through simple data science tasks such as obtaining data,
cleaning data, visualizing data, and basic data analysis. Students must have access to a fairly modern computer, ideally 
that supports hardware virtualization, on which they can install software. 

This class is open to sophomores, juniors, seniors and graduate students in any discipline.

Please refer to the [course syllabus](orientation/syllabus.md) for more information about course content and grading policies.
