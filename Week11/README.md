#Week 11 Overview#

## Functional Programming ##

In this week, you will learn about functional programming. This
programming paradigm employs functions to change the state of data,
where the functions process input data and produce outputs, without
changing the state of the rest of the program. Functional programming
can result in high performance computations for certain types of
problems, and can, therefore, be a useful skill to possess

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should accomplish the following learning objectives:######

- Understand the basic concepts behind functional programming.
- Understand how to employ the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` methods.
- Understand how to write and use lambda functions.
- Understand comprehensions and iterators.
