# Week 11 Lesson 2 #
## Functional Programming in Python ##

In this lesson, you will learn how to apply functional programming
within Python. First you will learn about employing the map, filter, and
reduce methods. Second, you will learn about lambda functions, which are
small, anonymous functions, that can simplify many functional
programming tasks. Note that many of the readings use Python2, so keep
that in mind when trying these concepts out in Python3 (for example, use
the `print` function, not the `print` statement, and the `reduce` function
is now in the `itertools` module).


###Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the `map` function and how to use it effectively.
- Understand the `filter` function and how to use it effectively.
- Understand the `reduce` function and how to use it effectively.
- Understand lambda functions and how to use them for functional programming.

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

### Readings ####

- [Functional programming](http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming) in Python2.

- [Lambda functions](http://www.python-course.eu/python3_lambda.php) in Python.

#### *Optional Additional Readings*####

- [Functional Programming in Python](http://alan-g.me.uk/tutor/tutfctnl.htm) article (don't worry yet
about comprehensions).

- Old article on Functional Programming in Python [Part 1](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-prog/index.html)
and [Part 2](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-prog2/index.html).
Note that are using Python2.
