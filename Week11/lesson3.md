# Week 11 Lesson 3 #
## Functional Programing in Python, Part II ##

In this lesson, you will learn an alternative approach to functional
programming in Python, that is specifically encouraged in Python3,
iterators and comprehensions. First, you will learn about list
comprehensions, which are an easy way to construct lists of items.
Second, you will learn about iterators, which enable functional
programming by simplifying the process of moving through items of data
in a collection, like a list. Finally, you will learn moe about these
constructs through a worked file system example.

###Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the iterator concept and how they can be broadly applied.
- Understand how to use a list comprehension to make a new list.
- Understand how to use an if clause in a list comprehension.
- Understand other comprehensions like dictionary or set.

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 3 hours.

### Readings ####
