# Week 11 Lesson 1 #
## Functional Programming ##

In this lesson, you will learn about functional programming, in which
functions operator on data without _side effects_. In this programming
paradigm data is transformed from one state to another by the
application of programs. This paradigm can produce high performance
since the functions can be vectorized over the data. Python, while not
strictly a functional programming language, does provide considerable
support for this programming paradigm. Learning functional programming
techniques in Python can, there fore, improve your ability to write
optimized applications.

###Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of functional programming.
- Understand how applying functions directly to data structures can improve code performance.
- Understand how to use a numpy ufuncs.
- Understand how to use Pandas apply.

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

### Readings ####

- Python [HowTo article](https://docs.python.org/dev/howto/functional.html#functional-programming-howto) on Functional Programming. Stop when you reach the _Iterator_ subsection.

- Numpy [ufunc](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html) discussion, stop after _Broadcasting_ section.

- Available [numpy ufunc list](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html#available-ufuncs).

- Pandas [apply](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html?highlight=apply#apply) method.

- Pandas [apply method](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html) api.

#### *Optional Additional Readings*####
