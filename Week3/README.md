## A Further Exploration into the Python Programming Language and Unix ##

This week you will begin to learn how to use the Python programming
language to write simple programs, and you will also learn about
permissions and controlling processes within Unix-like Systems. First,
you will learn about permission-related commands within Unix-like
systems, such as chmod, umask, su, sudo, chown, and chgrp. Second, you
will learn how to control processes within Unix-like systems through
commands including top, ps, jobs, bg, fg, kill, killall, and shutdown.
Third, you will learn how to perform various function calls within
Python, as well as create your own functions. Finally, you will learn
how to create conditional statements, value-returning functions and
iterating statements.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Know how to utilize various permissions-based commands, such as id, umask, sudo, etc. 
- Understand how to use various process-based commands, such as ps, top, bg, kill, etc.
- Be able to define new functions in Python.
