# Week 10 Lesson 2 #

## Distribution Functions ##

In this lesson, you will learn about the different types of distribution
functions that can be used to represent a data set, including both
discrete and continuous values. You will lear how to construct at
distribution functions from a data set, and how to use this
summarization to aid in the understanding of the data under analysis.


###Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand probability mass functions and their use to represent discrete data.
- Understand continous distribution function and how it can be used to infer relationships about data.
- Understand the different distributions functions like Normal, Poisson, and Chi-Squared distribution.

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 3 hours.

### Readings ####

In the Think Stats2 book, the author likes to hide details behind his
custom Python code. We don't agree with this appraoch, especially when
teaching the material. We encourage you to not use his code, but to use
standard Python data structures (like a dictionary) to represent the
distributions.
