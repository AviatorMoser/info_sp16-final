# Week 10 Lesson 3 #
## Visualizing distributions in Python ##

In this lesson, you will learn to make and interpret more advanced data
visualizations like  histograms by using MatPlotLib. Next you will learn
about improving the appearance of data visualizations to better convey
information, which we can easily do by using the Seaborn library.
Finally, you will learn how to use Seaborn to make visually more
appealing plots, how to use Kernel Density Estimation to improve
histograms, and how to make box plots and violin plots.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
