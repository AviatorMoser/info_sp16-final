# Week 13 Lesson 2 #
## Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Python ##

In this lesson, you will learn about implementing object oriented
programming concepts in Python. First, you will learn how to create a
`class` in Python, how to add class documentation strings, how to add
class attributes, and how to pass use class instances with general
functions. Next, you will learn about integrating classes more fully
within functions, how to support modification, and how to perform
prototyping.


###Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand how to create a `class` in Python.
- Understand how to initialize an object in Python
- Understand how to use classes to define new data types
- Understand ho to use these new data types within Python functions
