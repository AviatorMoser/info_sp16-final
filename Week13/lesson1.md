# Week 13 Lesson 1 #
## Introduction to Object Oriented Programming ##

In this lesson, you will learn about object oriented programming (OOP),
a paradigm in which new data types are created by using classes and
access to the data in these new data types can be controlled by using
methods. This enables a programmer to encapsulate the state of a system
to minimize unintentional side effects, and to (potentially) improve
performance. Existing classes can be extended by using inheritance, and
class hierarchies can be dynamically created to support polymorphism.

###Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the the fundamental concepts behind object oriented programming.
- Understand how OOP can be used to create new data types.
- Understand the concepts of encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.
