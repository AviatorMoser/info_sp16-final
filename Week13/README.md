#Week 13 Overview#

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) ##

In this week, you will learn about object oriented programming and how
to use this programming paradigm by using the Python programming
language. Specifically, you will learn how to create new data types in
Python by using a `class`, how to control access to the attributes of
this new data type by using _methods_, and how to leverage existing
objects through inheritance.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should accomplish the following learning objectives:######

- Understand the basic principles behind object oriented programming.
- Understand how to create and use classes in Python.
- Understand how to control access to class data via methods.
