# Week 13 Lesson 3 #
## Object Oriented Programming in Python ##

In this lesson, you will learn about more advanced object oriented
programming concepts and how to use them effectively by using the Python
programming language. This includes understanding the concept of classes
as interfaces and specific implementations of an interface. The use of
methods to encapsulate the state of an object, and finally the use of
inheritance to build object oriented hierarchies.


###Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of class methods.
- Understand how to define an interface.
- Understand how to create a succesful implementation of an interface.
- Understand how to use inheritance to construct object hierarchies.
- Understand the benefits of using encapsulation.
