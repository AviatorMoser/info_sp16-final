## Introduction to Python Data Processing ##

In this week, you will learn to perform basic data science tasks by
using Python. First, you will learn how to effectively use Pandas to
read and write data to a database directly from a `DataFrame`. Second,
you will learn about web pages, and how to programmatically extract data
from a web page or even websites. Finally, you will learn how to write a
Python program that extract data from a website, processes an XML-based
file to encode this information, in order to generate a new type of
visualization known as a Chloropeth.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should accomplish the following learning objectives:######

- Understand how to use Pandas to directly interact with a database
- Understand how to use a parsing library to extract information from a data file.
- Understand how the document object model.
- Understand how to extract data from website.
- Understand how to make a Chloropeth visualization.
