##Introduction to Data Analysis in Python##

In this week, you will learn to perform basic data analysis by using the
Python programming language. To simplify data analysis tasks when
working with Python we will first learn how to create and use fast
numerical arrays and matrices in Python by using the numpy library.
Numpy arrays underlie many of the Python data science software stack,
and thus understanding them can improve your overall efficacy. Next you
will be introduced to the Pandas library. Pandas introduces several new
data structures into the Python language, including the Series and the
DataFrame, both of which allow you to access data by a column label in
the same manner you used numerical indices with a NumPy array. Pandas
goes beyond this to allow you to select, aggregate and filter data by
using expressions when slicing data from a Pandas data structure.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should accomplish the following learning objectives:######

- Understand how to use the Numpy library to perform fast array and matrix operations
- Understand how to use the Pandas library to read and write structured data into a Python program.
- Understand how to use a Pandas DataFrame to select, group, and filter data.
